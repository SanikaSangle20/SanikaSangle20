    <p>Nutmeg is a spice derived from the seeds of the Myristica fragrans tree, also known as the nutmeg tree,
         and is a major component of the Konkan region's cuisine. The nutmeg tree, also called the "Wild Nutmeg" 
         (Knema attenuata) in the Western Ghats, is native to the Maluku Islands of Indonesia.
         In Konkani, the spice is known as "Japhal" (जाफळ)</p>
