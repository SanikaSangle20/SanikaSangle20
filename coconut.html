    <h2>&diam;<u>About Cocount</u></h2>
    <p>The coconut tree is a member of the palm tree family (Arecaceae) and the only living species of the genus Cocos.
         The term "coconut" can refer to the whole coconut palm, the seed, or the fruit, which botanically is a drupe, not a nut.
         They are ubiquitous in coastal tropical regions and are a cultural icon of the tropics.</p>
