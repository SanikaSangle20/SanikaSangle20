       <p>The Konkan region of Maharashtra, particularly coastal areas like Ratnagiri, Rajapur, and Devgad, is renowned for
         producing high-quality Alphonso mangoes. These mangoes are grown in mineral-rich red soil, considered to yield the best Alphonso mangoes globally. 
        The Alphonso, also known as "Hapus," is a seasonal fruit, harvested from late March through June. </p>
